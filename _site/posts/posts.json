PSA Singapore handles about a fifth of the world’s transhipped containers as the world’s busiest transhipment port.2 For more than four decades, PSA continuously developed and upgraded its container handling infrastructure, pioneered new systems and processes, and streamlined operations to meet the rapid growth in its container terminal business as part of the strive for operational excellence. 3\r\nUpon a vessel’s arrival at a berth in the container terminal, containers are discharged from and loaded onto it. A typical discharging operation starts with a quay crane picking up a container from the vessel and placing it onto a PM, which will then transport to a storage yard. At the yard, a yard crane picks up the container from the PM and shifts it to a designated spot. Loading operations involve the transporting of containers in the opposite direction, from the yard to the vessel.\r\nTherefore, PM productivity is of key interest to PSA as it is the main driver for the time taken to load and unload vessels. PM Productivity is defined as the sum of the total number of containers handled divided by the total hours. The following are the key terms which PSA uses to define PM productivity.\r\n\\[ Productivity = Total Containers Handled / Total Time \\] \\[Total Time = Sum (Est. Travel Time + Unproductive Time + Est. Wait Time + Non Work Time)\\]\r\nTotal Time is defined as the time difference between the two operation activities.\r\nEstimated Travel Time is the duration between two locations based on distance matrix with fixed speed limit/hr.\r\nNon-Work Time is the time taken for a change of driver, meal break, and PM breakdown (if any).\r\nUnproductive Time is the difference between long-off and log-on to the PM system (by the same driver).\r\nEstimated Wait Time = Total Time – Non-Work Time – Unproductive Time – Est. Travel Time\r\nProject Motivation\r\nThe study objective is to seek insight from Prime Mover (PM) Operations records to identify common characteristics exhibited by PM with high and low waiting times, through understanding of PM events and operational data. This, in turn, enables us to pinpoint and identify correlated attributes and embark on further study to improve the overall productivity of PM operations and resource utilisation through active targeting of activities contributing to the PM waiting time.\r\nReview of Existing Work\r\nPSA Internal Work Current operation performances are tracked using Operation Indicators such as PM productivity and PM waiting time aggregated by duration, from shifts to monthly reports and breakdown by individual terminal and PM.\r\nPrevious studies on PM operation efficiency typically focus on crane productivity by work schedule , and resource planning & deployment to find the optimal number of PMs and trucks (haulier) to reduce average PM waiting time.\r\nProposed Scope and Methodology\r\nThis study seeks to create an R Shiny app that allows for users to input parameters to suit their needs.\r\nInteractive dashboard that allows for Operations Managers to understand\r\nSummary statistics for PM events\r\nHistograms for wait time with parameters for each type of container\r\nTime series (across hours) for wait times with variable parameters for shift changes at 7am and 7pm\r\n\r\nAverage PM wait time by cntr length by time of day \r\nAverage PM wait time by equipment type by time of day \r\nTree maps for container types and movements \r\nBar charts of container types  vii. Scatter Plots (Total duration of entry vs waiting time)\r\n\r\nPerformance of Terminals\r\nHistograms for wait time with parameters for each type of container \r\n\r\nPerformance of type of containers (Dangerous Goods, Reefer, General Purpose) & size of containers (20-footer, 40-footer, Oversized)\r\nPerformance of type of equipment (Quay crane, various types of Yard Cranes)\r\n\r\nConfirmatory data analysis\r\nUncertainty analysis through calculation of median and confidence intervals of time spent based on types and sizes of containers, different terminals, Equipment type, Day/night shifts, different yard activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution comparisons between categories of containers(e.g. using box plots, violin plots)\r\nMultivariate analysis using cross tabs\r\nParallel coordinates analysis\r\n\r\nStoryboard and Visualisation Features\r\n-Insert dashboard-\r\nData Source\r\nThe data source used is provided by PSA Singapore’s PM OPS dataset that contains anonymised PM operation event records in a generic 12 hr shift in 2019. There are approximately 65,000 records with 69 variables as follows:\r\nS/N\r\nVariable Name\r\nDescription\r\n1\r\n[SHIFT_D]\r\nDate of shift\r\n2\r\n[TERMINAL_ID]\r\nContainer Terminal ID\r\n3\r\n[PM_N]\r\nPM Number/ID\r\n4\r\n[CHASSIS_N]\r\nTrailer Number/ID\r\n5\r\n[PM_DRIVER_IC_N]\r\nDriver Employee ID\r\n6\r\n[HAULIER_PARTY_C]\r\nHaulier Party Code derived from Organization code\r\n7\r\n[ACTIVITY_SEQ_C]\r\nOperation event sequence\r\n8\r\n[EVENT_C]\r\nEvent Code DISC = Discharge from vessel LOAD = Load to vessel EQOF = Equipment Offload from PM to Yard Crane EQMT = Equipment Mount to PM from Yard Crane LOGN = driver logon to system LOGF = Driver Log off from system\r\n9\r\n[EVENT_DT]\r\nEvent Datetime\r\n10\r\n[EVENT_SHIFT_I]\r\nShift indicator D =Day N = Night\r\n11\r\n[PREV_EVENT_C]\r\nPrevious Event Code\r\n12\r\n[PREV_EVENT_DT]\r\nPrevious Event Datetime\r\n13\r\n[PREV_CNTR_EVENT_C]\r\nPrevious Container Event Code\r\n14\r\n[PREV_CNTR_EVENT_DT]\r\nPrevious Container Event Datetime\r\n15\r\n[MOVE_OP_C]\r\nMove Operation Code filtered to “O” Ship Ops for this study\r\n16\r\n[MOVE_TYPE_C]\r\nMove Type Code\r\n17\r\n[CNTR_N]\r\nContainer Number\r\n18\r\n[LENGTH_Q]\r\nContainer Length e.g 20 40 45 48 ft\r\n19\r\n[CNTR_TYPE_C]\r\nContainer Type RF = Reefer GP = General Purpose DG = Dangerous Goods OH = Over height Container UC = UnContainerized\r\n20\r\n[CAT_C]\r\nCategory Code\r\n21\r\n[PURP_C]\r\nPurpose Code\r\n22\r\n[WT_Q]\r\nWeight of Container\r\n23\r\n[HEIGHT_Q]\r\nHeight of Container for OH and UC Container\r\n24\r\n[CNTR_ST_C]\r\nContainer Status E = Empty , F = Full\r\n25\r\n[CNTR_OPR_C]\r\nContainer Operator Code\r\n26\r\n[DG_I]\r\nDangerous Good Indicator\r\n27\r\n[REEFER_I]\r\nReefer Indicator\r\n28\r\n[UC_I]\r\nUncontainerized Indicator\r\n29\r\n[OVER_SIZE_I]\r\nOver Size Container Indicator\r\n30\r\n[SHPMT_CNTR_ST_C]\r\nShipment Container Status Code\r\n31\r\n[SPECIAL_DETAIL_X]\r\n\r\n32\r\n[DIRECT_HDLG_I]\r\n\r\n33\r\n[REEFER_TEMP_Q]\r\nReefer Temperature\r\n34\r\n[DG_GROUP_C]\r\nDG Group Code\r\n35\r\n[DG_IMO_CLASS_C]\r\nDG IMO Class Code\r\n36\r\n[IMP_HAULIER_C]\r\nImport Haulier Code\r\n37\r\n[EXP_HAULIER_C]\r\nExport Haulier Code\r\n38\r\n[DISC_ABBR_VESSEL_M]\r\nDischarge Vessel Name\r\n39\r\n[DISC_ABBR_VOYAGE_IN_N]\r\nDischarge Vessel Voyage inbound\r\n40\r\n[LOAD_ABBR_VESSEL_M]\r\nLoad Vessel Name\r\n41\r\n[LOAD_ABBR_VOYAGE_OUT_N]\r\nLoad Vessel Voyage Outbound\r\n42\r\n[EQUIPMENT_N]\r\nEquipment ID\r\n43\r\n[EQUIPMENT_TYPE_C]\r\nEquipment Type Code (Quay Crane and Type of Yard Cranes)\r\n44\r\n[OPR_USER_ID]\r\nOperator User ID\r\n45\r\n[PREV_EQUIPMENT_N]\r\nPrevious Equipment ID\r\n46\r\n[PREV_EQUIPMENT_TYPE_C]\r\nPrevious Equipment Type Code\r\n47\r\n[PREV_OPR_USER_ID]\r\nPrevious Operator User ID\r\n48\r\n[LOCATION_C]\r\nCurrent Location Code\r\n49\r\n[LOCATION_TYPE_C]\r\nCurrent Location Type\r\n50\r\n[PREV_LOCATION_C]\r\nPrevious Location code\r\n51\r\n[PREV_LOCATION_TYPE_C]\r\nPrevious Location Type\r\n52\r\n[DEPLOYED_ABBR_VESSEL_M]\r\nDeployed Vessel Name\r\n53\r\n[DEPLOYED_ABBR_VOYAGE_N]\r\nDeployed Voyage Code\r\n54\r\n[DEPLOYED_QC_N]\r\nDeployed QC number\r\n55\r\n[DEPLOYED_LOCATION_C]\r\nDeployed Location Code\r\n56\r\n[BOX_Q]\r\nNumber of Containers\r\n57\r\n[PM_DISTANCE_Q]\r\nDistance travelled from previous location\r\n58\r\n[PM_TRAVEL_TIME_Q]\r\nTravel Time\r\n59\r\n[PM_WAIT_TIME_Q]\r\nWait Time\r\n60\r\n[PM_UNPRODUCTIVE_TIME_Q]\r\nUnproductive Time\r\n61\r\n[PM_NON_WORK_TIME_Q]\r\nNon work Time\r\n62\r\n[PM_PRODUCTIVE_TIME_Q]\r\nProductive Time\r\n63\r\n[PM_TIME_DIFF_Q]\r\n\r\n64\r\n[BATCH_ID]\r\nBatch ID\r\n65\r\n[LOGON_DT]\r\nDriver Logon datetime\r\n66\r\n[LOGOFF_DT]\r\nDriver Logoff datetime\r\n67\r\n[TRIP_ID]\r\nTrip ID\r\n68\r\n[EVENT_TRIP_N]\r\nEvent Trip number\r\n69\r\n[PRODUCTIVE_MOVE_N]\r\nproductive move number\r\nApplication Libraries & Packages\r\nR Shiny\r\nggplot\r\ntidyverse\r\nRMarkdown\r\ndplyr\r\nggstatsplot\r\ninfer\r\nTask Breakdown\r\nThe areas of responsibility are foreseen to be as follows.\r\nTasks\r\nTeam Members Responsible\r\nIntroduction and business problem definition\r\nKC\r\nData acquisition and preparation - cleaning & anonymisation\r\nZL\r\nLiterature Review\r\nKC\r\nExploratory Data Analysis -Time Series -Scatter Plots (total duration of entry vs waiting time)\r\nZL\r\nExploratory Data Analysis - Treemaps (container types & terminals) - Pie / Bar charts (activity counts) - Histograms (waiting time, driving time)\r\nKC\r\nConfirmatory Data Analysis - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) - Equal / Unequal variance - Normal / Not normal distribution\r\nZL\r\nConfirmatory Data Analysis - Parallel coordinates analysis to visualise key relationships\r\nKC / ZL (Tbc)\r\nUncertainty - Median, confidence intervals via box plots / violin plots for waiting times - Error bars\r\nKC\r\nInsights and recommendations for actions\r\nKC\r\nLimitations and conclusion\r\nZL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

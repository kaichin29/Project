# Introduction

# Motivation and Objectives
* Motivated by the general lack of effective and easy to use web-enabled data visualization tool to conduct data analysis on PM operation data.
* To enable operation managers the ability to monitor,drill down and identify key attributes and continuous improvement to processes contributing to the PM productivity.

### Design Principles
* Reproducibility
* Interactivity
* Simplicity

“overview first, zoom and filter into details”, bouncing back and forth, here and there, with ease and without interrupting their train of thought. 

# Approach

* Data Wrangling
* 1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
  + Treemap
  + Bar Chart
  + Histogram   
  
* 2. Confirmatory Data Analysis(CDA)
  + Scatter Plot
  + Box-violin Plot  

* 3. Quality Control Analysis 
  + Cause and effect Diagram
  + Pareto Analysis
  + Control Chart Analysis  

* 4. Analysis and Insights


# Analysis and Insights
### 1. EDA
![](barchart1.png){width=680px}

Interactive bar chart allows changing of chart components, main, fill, & colour variable, grouping facet.

![](hist1.png){width=680px}

Interactive histogram helps display of distributions for PM wait time and travel time.

### 2. CDA
![](scatter1.png){width=400}

Scatter plot allows for exploring correlation between PM Wait Time and Travel Time

![](violin1.png){width=400}
Box-violin plot showcases and compares data distribution between variables


### 3. Quality Control Analysis 
* Cause and effect Diagram

Cause and effect Diagram or Ishikawa/fishbone Diagram helps managers to identify potential factors causing an overall effect of low productivity.
![](fishbone.PNG){width=80%}
```{R echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("SixSigma")
#Effect
effect<-"Less Productivity"

#Causes
causes.head<-c("Measurement", "Procedures/Plans", "Methods", "Environment", "Personnel", "Equipment")

#Individual Causes
causes<-vector(mode = "list", length = length(causes.head))
causes[1]<-list(c("Data error","KPI Definition" ))
causes[2]<-list(c("Roster/Schedule", "Logistic","Deployment","Compliance"))
causes[3]<-list(c("Sampling", "Analytical Procedure","Data Collection"))
causes[4]<-list(c("Traffic", "Weather","Seasonality"))
causes[5]<-list(c("Shifts","Training","Operators","Incentives"))
causes[6]<-list(c("Leakage", "Breakdown","Maintenance"))

   #   ss.ceDiag(effect,causes.head,causes,sub="",ss.col = c("","red"))

```

## Pareto Chart

Using Pareto Chart to determine and focus effort on the major contributors of PM operation time spent hence affecting the overall PM productivity.



## Control Chart

Using a variety type of control charts with control limits of 3 standard deviation, we can study the stability of the current process, analyze and make improvements, and monitor the results of the newly implemented process. The data obtained from the process can also be applied to predict future performances.


### 4. Insights

![](hist1.png)

Terminal V48_8 has a very long tail, with a significant number of PMs waiting past 15 minutes. Need to explore why Terminal V48_8 is performing significantly worse than the other terminals would be a key takeaway that operation managers can explore further on.  


![](hist2.png)

Tuesdays, Wednesday, and Thursday have seen significantly longer tails without any significant volume increases. Need to explore what is the root cause.

# Future Work 
* Implement automated check sheet to flag occurrence of long waiting or traveling time event.
* Take advantage of AGV implementation in new port to implement new IoT & GPS sensor data to improve data accuracy. 
* Conduct workshops with key stakeholders to improve application and expand functionality
  + Add data upload capability
  + Introduce linear regression function with additional data from new equipment
